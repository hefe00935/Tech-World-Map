## Overview

Tech Monitor is a real-time intelligence dashboard designed for high-signal environments.

It fuses global infrastructure data, AI classification pipelines, and streaming anomaly detection into a single operational interface.

Built for clarity.  
Designed for velocity.  
Optimized for signal.
